## DESCRIPTION
This report aims at automatically controlling the speed of vehicles at speed
restricted areas such as schools, hospital zones etc. Nowadays the drivers drive
vehicles at high speed even in speed limited areas without considering the safety of
the public. The traffic police are not able to control them with full effect. Also it is
not practical to monitor these areas throughout. This report paves way for controlling
the speed of the vehicles within certain limit in restricted zones without interruption
of the drivers. An RFID is used for this purpose. The RFID reader is attached along
with the vehicle and the RFID Tag with these Zones. These tags are programmed to
send a coded signal when the reader comes in proximity. Whenever the vehicles
enter into these zones their receivers will receive this code and the speed of the
vehicles is controlled automatically with the help of the Arduino present inside the
vehicle. The tags are placed at the beginning and the end of the regions for which
the speed should be reduced.
