## PIC MICROCONTROLLER 16F877A
Microcontroller is a general purpose device, which integrates a number of the components of a microprocessor system on to single chip. It has inbuilt CPU, memory and peripherals to make it as a mini computer. A microcontroller combines on to the same microchip: The CPU core, Memory(both ROM and RAM), some parallel digital i/o. Microcontrollers are smaller in size, consumes less power, inexpensive.

## BLUE TOOTH

HC-05 module is an easy to use Bluetooth SPP (Serial Port Protocol) module, designed for transparent wireless serial connection setup. It is used for many applications like wireless headset, game controllers, wireless mouse, wireless keyboard and many more consumer applications. It has range up to <100m which depends upon transmitter and receiver, atmosphere, geographic & urban conditions. HC-05 is a Bluetooth module which is designed for wireless comunication. This module can be used in a master or slave configuration. It has 6 pins namely: Key/EN, Data mode, Command mode, VCC, GND, TXD, RXD, State. Refer to figure 3.2. To communicate smartphone with HC-05 Bluetooth module, smartphone requires Bluetooth terminal application for transmitting and receiving data.
